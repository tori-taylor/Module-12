# Bellybutton Biodiversity
The purpose of this assignment was to take sample data of bacteria on individuals belly buttons, and create an interative web dashboard to view the results.
My dashboard can be found here: https://tori-taylor.github.io/Module-12/

I used code from https://github.com/nicoserrano/Belly-Button-Biodiversity for charts.js
